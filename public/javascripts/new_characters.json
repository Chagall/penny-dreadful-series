    "description": "Abraham Van Helsing was a hematologist who became a vampire hunter after his wife became a vampire. Van Helsing killed her by cutting off her head and driving a stake through her heart. Through his extensive studies on vampires he discovered that vampiric saliva contains an agent which prevents blood clotting, making it easier for them to feed. He named this phenomenon \"Hannah's wink\" in honour of his wife.",
    "appAndPersonality": "Professor Abraham Van Helsing was an elderly man of about sixty, with a lean physique and a serious face. The silvery hair was thick at the sides and on the sideburns but sparse on the head. Dressed in dark and elegant suits as befitted a scholar and reputable doctor.\nVan Helsing was very courteous, friendly and willing to help others, as demonstrated in his short but intense relationship with Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Despite being a renomate doctor and a skilled hematologist, he was also aware of the existence of a demimonde populated by hellish creatures because of the tragic events of his past that made him stubborn in facing adversity with greater self-awareness.",
    "history": "Using Fenton as a test subject, Sir Malcolm Murray hired Professor Van Helsing to help Dr. Frankenstein with experiments to find a cure for vampirism, having heard great things about the professional qualities of Van Helsing in hematology. Van Helsing immediately established a good understanding with the young surgeon, warning him first on the existence of vampire blood, and then the very existence of the creatures themselves. However, the friendship between the two doctors was abruptly cut short when the Creature, angry with his creator, killed Professor Van Helsing in a dark alley right in front of an extremely terrified Victor.",

She decided to escape this life by moving to London and becoming who she really wanted to be. She created a new identity, Angelique, and later became a prostitute. In London, Angelique approached Dorian Gray at an outdoor caf√© where she noticed him staring at a photograph of Vanessa Ives. She assumed Vanessa was Dorian's sister since they both had pale skin, dark hair and intoxicating eyes, but he corrected her and explained that Vanessa was just a friend. This gave Angelique an opportunity to sit down with Dorian and introduce herself. Dorian was intrigued by Angelique's boldness, and the two shared a flirtatious conversation filled with innuendo. It became obvious that Dorian was still heartbroken over Vanessa, and Angelique picked up on this, telling him about her own heartbreak and how she had been sadder ever since she swore off love. She then left him with her business card in case he ever wanted to mend his broken heart. Dorian later visited Angelique's brothel. Her madame assured Dorian that he wouldn't be disappointed, and that he should handle her firmly since she was wilful like a child. Angelique undressed, revealing her male genitalia, but Dorian was unfazed by the fact that she was transgender. Dorian and Angelique shared another date, where he took her to the Gossima Parlour. The pair were seen together quite publicly when Dorian threw a ball at his mansion as a coming out of sorts for Angelique. She became the jilted lover however, when Dorian laid eyes on Lily, who had arrived on the arm of Victor. Angelique and Victor found themselves both forgotten when Dorian and Lily entered the dance floor together.Angelique found herself abandoned again when Dorian left the mansion to go out on the town. While alone, she discovered his hidden painting, and just remained in the room with it until his return. When he finally did return, he offered her wine, but unfortunately for Angelique the price for discovering Dorian's painting was a deadly one, as Dorian had laced the drink with poison to protect his secret.",

Bartholomew Rusk first came into contact with Ethan Chandler while investing the grisly Mariner's Inn Massacre, when Ethan denied any knowledge of it yet had been a resident at the Inn for some time leading up to the killings. Moreover, Rusk's suspicions about Ethan deepened when he could not verify the background of the American. Rusk's investigation eventually led to the home Sir Malcolm Murray where he questioned Murry about Ethan's past, and he was again met with denial with Murry claiming no knowledge of Chandler despite Ethan's frequent visits. Rusk then set a watch on the mansion in the hope of catching Ethan. When the American finally did arrive, Rusk informed him that his every move would be watched, and that he had learned of Ethan's true identity, Ethan Lawrence Talbot. Ethan eventually approached Rusk's office and admitted to committing the Mariner's Inn Massacre, asking to be hanged as soon as possible. Rusk then revealed that Ethan was instead to be extradited back to the Americas. He had received the extradition order weeks earlier, but had refrained from acting upon it because he wanted the satisfaction of hearing Ethan's confession beforehand. After bringing Ethan to America, Ethan's father sends men to intercept Ethan to bring him home. Rusk tells the federal marshals that he will hunt him down with them. After catching up, Rusk discovers the men that rescued Ethan slaughtered from him during the full moon, and discover someone is helping Ethan. After Hecate Poole uses her magic to kill all but the lead marshal and Rusk, Rusk vows to now kill Ethan instead of capture the first chance he gets, regardless of his moral code, claiming he will even shoot him in the back if the opportunity arises.",

His determination not to be alone results in him threatening Victor Frankenstein with the death of all he loves unless he creates for him an immortal bride.

    "history": "When Hecate's mother expressed \"a certain modicum of disappointment\" in the failure of one of her coven, she killed the offending witch, much to Hecate's amusement, thus leaving Hecate to take over as leader of the younger members of the coven. Evelyn then assigned Hecate the task of dealing with Chandler, whom they had discovered would be a formidable obstacle in turning Vanessa Ives to their cause. Hecate stalked a young couple through London, eventually following them into the Underground. In an otherwise deserted rail carriage, she murdered the couple and absconded with their infant child, whom she delivered to her mother. Evelyn used the child's organs in the creation of a fetish doll of Vanessa. Under the guise of \"Hecate Aphrodite Livingston\", an American abroad, Hecate staged an accident in view of Chandler, so that he would rush to rescue her. The pair chatted in a caf√©, with Hecate explaining that she was named after a Greek sea goddess. Chandler, however, saw through her disguise, pointing out a number of errors in her alleged background, accent, and even wardrobe. Thinking she was sent by Pinkerton, he gave her a message for his father and stormed off. When reporting her results to Evelyn, Hecate admitted that while Chandler rationalized his distrust through the errors she had made, he must have smelled her and was thus on guard. Evelyn agreed there could no longer be any doubt that Chandler was a Lupus Dei, and warned her daughter not to fail her again. When Hecate asked what to do about Chandler that evening, Evelyn dismissively reminded her daughter that Vanessa's fate is the only one that really matters. At Malcolm's house, Chandler related the incident to Vanessa, who explained that Hecate was actually a moon goddess and was a patron of witches; it's not likely that the woman he met was actually after him. Later that evening, Hecate and the nightcomers attacked and eventually made off with a lock of Vanessa's hair. As she left, Hecate taunted Chandler. Being faithful to the promise of serving Ethan, Hecate followed him to America, where she narrowly avoided being shot by men in the employ of Ethan's father, Jared Talbot, as they stormed the train Ethan was being transported on. Then, having followed Ethan and his captors to a small town, Hecate used her power to help him escape. Once on the run, Hecate made moves to corrupt Ethan, initially battling his distrust to eventually coaxing him to reveal more of his past. At one point, she persuaded him to let her use his blood for a dark ritual in which she caused a writhing mass of snakes to attack the camp of the marshals pursuing them, and later seduced him while they were sheltering in a cave. But without water, the pair were soon deprived of their horses and were succumbing to dehydration as they trudged through the desert. Luckily they were found by Sir Malcolm, although not so luckily also chanced upon by a gang of Jared Talbot's men, who brought them back to the Talbot homestead. When Hecate recovered, she convinced Ethan to carry out his plan to murder his father.",

    "description": "Sir Geoffrey Hawkes is a minor character in Season 2 of Penny Dreadful, and is a minor lord and landowner. ",
    "appAndPersonality": "",
    "history": "Sir Geoffrey Hawkes was a landowner before he fell into the sway of Evelyn Poole. She needed him to exert pressure on Joan Clayton in order to claim The Poetry of Death, a cursed book in Clayton's home. To that end, Hawkes was seduced by Evelyn and persuaded to do all he could to buy out her property, or force Joan to leave. Part of this also included a campaign of harassment against the old Cut-Wife of Ballentree Moor. When efforts to force Clayton out failed, Evelyn goaded Sir Geoffrey and a handful of townsfolk into taking action. Sir Geoffrey then led a lynch mob to Ballentree Moor and called Clayton outside. They bound her, and doused her in oil before setting her alight, and then turned on her ward Vanessa Ives, whom they branded with a hot branding iron in the middle of her back before departing. Five years later, Sir Geoffrey chanced upon Miss Ives and Ethan Chandler as they were out walking in the woods. He made lurid comments, and threatened the pair with his pack of dogs, before spurring his horse and departing. Later at night he went out to feed his dogs, unaware that Vanessa had opened The Poetry of Death, and was driving them into a rabid fury from afar. The dogs turned on Hawkes and mauled him to death.",

    "description": "Sir Malcolm Murray is a British explorer of the African continent who is on a deep personal quest. Sir Malcolm has nonetheless paid a heavy price for his exciting career. Although his stately home is filled with souvenirs from his travels, it is devoid of family and loved ones. With Vanessa's help, he is determined to right the wrongs of his past, but the toughest journey is yet to come.",
    "appAndPersonality": "Sir Malcolm is a hard, shrewd and intelligent man, a once jovial and enthusiastic explorer turned cold by the anger and guilt he feels over his son's death, his daughter's disappearance and his estrangement from his wife. He comes across at times as a father figure to Vanessa, for the two have a mutual admiration and deep understanding of one another. However, it is clear, to a certain extent, that Malcolm harbors dislike and disgust for Vanessa over her role in Mina's disappearance. These feelings are also mutual, in that Vanessa has a low opinion of Malcolm: she describes him as being vainglorious, arrogant and hypocritical, having been far more interested in exploring and collecting trophies in Africa, consequently serving his ego, than in the welfare of his children. She also chastises him for his own infidelity through his affair with Vanessa's mother. Their past actions are a prominent source of friction between the two of them, yet Vanessa respects Malcolm in that he is a cunning strategist and a leader to the others.",
    "history": "Sir Malcolm Murray established himself as an explorer of the African continent, which ultimately put a strain on his marriage later in life after fathering two children. While becoming well known for his foreign exploits he made matters worse on the home front by indulging in an affair.[1] Not only did he lose his wife, but also his son and daughter. His son, not very well equipped for a harsh life exploring Africa died during his first expedition with Sir Malcolm, and his daughter was taken years later by a vampire. It was this latest loss that drove Sir Malcolm into the role of a monster hunter, seeking out vampires in an effort to find and recover his daughter.",

She is keenly observant - clairvoyant even - as well as an expert medium, and has lent her talents to Sir Malcolm Murray in his search for his daughter, Vanessa's childhood friend Mina Murray. Her supernatural gifts are powerful and useful to those around her, but they are also a heavy burden. Her inner demons are very real to her and everyone around her, and they threaten to destroy her relationships, her sanity and her very life.",
    "appAndPersonality": "",
    "history": "Vanessa was born to Gordon and Claire Ives, a wealthy family who were neighbours to the Murray Family. As a child she had an extremely close relationship with the Murray girl Mina, a relationship with a bond closer than sisters. Vanessa also had a close relationship with Mina's older brother Peter Murray, whom she intended to marry when she was older. Vanessa's innocence was forever ripped away when she witnessed Sir Malcolm and her mother in one of their sexual escapades, and this became the start of a bitter falling out between the two families. She grew to resent Mina for all her good fortune, and began to demonstrate some scandalous habits, having kissed Peter out of turn and having a sexual escapade of her own with Mina's fianc√©. Her downward spiral became most evident when she fell victim to the possession of an evil spirit, which eventually led to the death of her mother. Vanessa then spent a considerable amount of time with Joan Clayton, the Cut-Wife of Ballentree Moor, a witch who began tutoring her in the ways of the daywalkers. She grew to have a deep bond with her mentor, to such a point that Vanessa walked with Joan as she was led to the tree in front of her hovel to be burned alive due to the machinations of Evelyn Poole. Joan reciprocated this by leaving the hovel and everything in it to Vanessa and preparing her for the coming battle against the nightcomers. In 1891, Vanessa visited the Wildwest Show and grew interested in its primary performer Ethan Chandler. Intending to employ him as an armed assistant, she met him in a bar and presented him with an offer to do some night work. Deducing that his entire performance as the Wildwest show was a lie, she made a few accurate comments about his appearance and behaviour. She was pleased by his acceptance of her offer, and provided an address for their meeting that very night. Vanessa was surprised to see that Ethan was on time. She escorted him into a building on the nearby street, which was an opium den. There, she greeted Sir Malcolm Murray and introduced Chandler as their accomplice. Sir Malcolm took them underground where three suspicious men stood. The men attacked, and amidst the fighting Vanessa heard tormented wails, and sought desperately for their source.",

    "appAndPersonality": "Dr Victor Frankenstein is perceived by some as being a tender, gentle soul who is fascinated by life and death. He is considered to have the soul of a poet when it comes describing his feelings towards the subject. He is highly intelligent and is capable of kindness, but at times displays a darker nature in that he is arrogant and openly disdainful towards others, perceived to have a cold, or \"bloodless\" approach to certain situations. He has dedicated himself to researching what makes something live, and has sacrificed everything for his scientific pursuit. However, he is playing with fire, and his research pays off in shocking ways with devastating consequences. He is a young man in his twenties. Victor is an attractive man with dark hair, blue eyes (commonly having red patches encircling his eyes) and a thin body. He is addicted to morphine due to being dosed with a cocaine solution to treat his asthma which he suffered from as a child. This is first seen in Season 1: Episode Possession. Through Season 2, it is seen more often as he speaks about it with Malcolm and Vanessa. By the Season 2 Finale, he cannot find veins in his arm so has moved to injecting into his hand (Also appears to be slowly losing his sanity, as he has lost Lily and his experience at Evelyn Poole's house seems to have pushed him over the edge).",
    "history": "Victor Frankenstein was born into a wealthy family. Suffering from poor health, he spent his time with his mother, who gave him a passion for literature until she died, and the young Victor developed a morbid curiosity about death mechanisms. At an appropriate age he began to attend college where he and fellow student Henry Jekyll began research frowned upon by the faculty. Abandoning his studies, Frankenstein refines his experiments and manages to revive a corpse. Disgusted by the creature he has created, Victor flees, leaving his creation at the mercy of his own misery. Arriving in London, he started working at the morgue of a resurrectionist so he can resume his studies and experiments with fresh corpses. In this period he revitalizes a second creature, better than the first, which is named Proteus after a Shakespearean character. While Victor is intent on dissecting an arm at the slaughterhouse of the resurrectionist, he is approached by Sir Malcolm, Miss Ives and Ethan Chandler who ask him to do an autopsy on a mysterious corpse, which immediately captivates the young surgeon attention. Following, the young doctor was invited to join the group, bringing benefit to the fight against the evil creatures with his medical knowledges, because according to Sir Malcolm Victor is not afraid to lift the skin and watch underneath it. While Victor is increasingly integrated in the group, his first creation returns and kills Proteus in a fit of jealousy, threatening Victor to make his life a living hell and forcing the doctor to create for him an immortal bride. Victor then feels compelled to fulfill the wishes of the Creature, moved by fear and guilt. Once discovered that Ethan Chandler's lover Brona Croft is close to death due to tuberculosis, Victor gives her a gentle death and bring her to his lab, where he prepares the woman to be revived thanks to unknown procedures which include, among other things, the use of electricity caused by a massive storm[2]. Once awakened, Victor deceives the woman making her believe to be his cousin Lily Frankenstein and the Creature fianc√©e. During their time together, Victor falls in love with \"Lily\", even confiding in Vanessa asking her advice in matters of love. Although the two consume a loving relationship, Lily has other projects and teams up with Dorian Gray, breaking Victor's heart. Meanwhile, Evelyn Poole's enchantment thrives on Victor as well, causing him to have visions of his three creatures accusing him of unspeakable sins. This pushes Victor to recklessly take refuge in drugs again. Weighed down by grief of loss and guilt, Victor contact his old colleague and friend Henry Jekyll to help him destroy Lily, thus preventing the woman to commit other murders, as Victor feels responsible for the actions of the monster he created",

After the attack at the end of \"Grand Guignol\", Roper is seen with his face heavily bandaged, with one part of his face mutilated, in the episode \"Verbis Diablo\". He is set to become a serious antagonist for Ethan, driven solely by revenge at losing both his friend Mr Kidd, and also over his disfigurements. To cover his facial mutilations, he is seen at some point in Season 2 as donning a metal and leather mask over one side of his face.",
