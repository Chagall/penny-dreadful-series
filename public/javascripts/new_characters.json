    "portrayedBy": "David Warner",
    "description": "Abraham Van Helsing was a hematologist who became a vampire hunter after his wife became a vampire. Van Helsing killed her by cutting off her head and driving a stake through her heart. Through his extensive studies on vampires he discovered that vampiric saliva contains an agent which prevents blood clotting, making it easier for them to feed. He named this phenomenon \"Hannah's wink\" in honour of his wife.",
    "appAndPersonality": "Professor Abraham Van Helsing was an elderly man of about sixty, with a lean physique and a serious face. The silvery hair was thick at the sides and on the sideburns but sparse on the head. Dressed in dark and elegant suits as befitted a scholar and reputable doctor.\nVan Helsing was very courteous, friendly and willing to help others, as demonstrated in his short but intense relationship with Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Despite being a renomate doctor and a skilled hematologist, he was also aware of the existence of a demimonde populated by hellish creatures because of the tragic events of his past that made him stubborn in facing adversity with greater self-awareness.",
    "history": "Using Fenton as a test subject, Sir Malcolm Murray hired Professor Van Helsing to help Dr. Frankenstein with experiments to find a cure for vampirism, having heard great things about the professional qualities of Van Helsing in hematology. Van Helsing immediately established a good understanding with the young surgeon, warning him first on the existence of vampire blood, and then the very existence of the creatures themselves. However, the friendship between the two doctors was abruptly cut short when the Creature, angry with his creator, killed Professor Van Helsing in a dark alley right in front of an extremely terrified Victor.",

Angelique is a woman of the world who wears fine clothes of bright colors with bows and crinolines. The difficulty of her existence since her very childhood have tempered her character, making Angelique a jaunty and provocative woman, who also hides a gentle soul that desperately seeks the gentle touch of a lover. In order not to preclude any pleasure to herself, Angelique decided to be ceded to the most uninhibited vices by working as an uptown prostitute.",
    "history": "Angelique knew from the moment she was born that she was not the same as the other boys. Her parents resented her for not being normal, and ultimately ignored her and pushed her away. She decided to escape this life by moving to London and becoming who she really wanted to be. She created a new identity, Angelique, and later became a prostitute. In London, Angelique approached Dorian Gray at an outdoor caf√© where she noticed him staring at a photograph of Vanessa Ives. She assumed Vanessa was Dorian's sister since they both had pale skin, dark hair and intoxicating eyes, but he corrected her and explained that Vanessa was just a friend. This gave Angelique an opportunity to sit down with Dorian and introduce herself. Dorian was intrigued by Angelique's boldness, and the two shared a flirtatious conversation filled with innuendo. It became obvious that Dorian was still heartbroken over Vanessa, and Angelique picked up on this, telling him about her own heartbreak and how she had been sadder ever since she swore off love. She then left him with her business card in case he ever wanted to mend his broken heart. Dorian later visited Angelique's brothel. Her madame assured Dorian that he wouldn't be disappointed, and that he should handle her firmly since she was wilful like a child. Angelique undressed, revealing her male genitalia, but Dorian was unfazed by the fact that she was transgender. Dorian and Angelique shared another date, where he took her to the Gossima Parlour. The pair were seen together quite publicly when Dorian threw a ball at his mansion as a coming out of sorts for Angelique. She became the jilted lover however, when Dorian laid eyes on Lily, who had arrived on the arm of Victor. Angelique and Victor found themselves both forgotten when Dorian and Lily entered the dance floor together.Angelique found herself abandoned again when Dorian left the mansion to go out on the town. While alone, she discovered his hidden painting, and just remained in the room with it until his return. When he finally did return, he offered her wine, but unfortunately for Angelique the price for discovering Dorian's painting was a deadly one, as Dorian had laced the drink with poison to protect his secret.",

    "appAndPersonality": "Bartholomew Rusk is a middle aged man with brown hair, of average height and build. His right arm was lost while serving in the British army, so he has a prostetic one made of wood. Rusk is a strongly dedicated and highly capable policeman and detective. He proves to be both highly intelligent and very observant, such as when he quickly figures out that Ethan is responsible for the killings in London, and also that the events going on are somewhat supernatural. Rusk makes an effort to be constantly polite, and is incredibly motivated as demonstrated by him personally escorting Ethan to America, and continuing to hunt him down after he escaped. Its implied that Rusk is aware of the existence of supernatural beings, to an extent, admitting experiences have made him more open minded. He even advises the US Marshal to start believing in the Occult when hunting Ethan.",
    "history": "While in the military, Rusk's regiment were tracking an assassin who lead them into a ambush in which Rusk was shot in his right arm. Despite his injury Rusk continued alone to track the assassin and first reported to the infirmary after dragging the assassin to Cape Town. By that point his wound had become infected necessitating the amputation of the arm. Bartholomew Rusk first came into contact with Ethan Chandler while investing the grisly Mariner's Inn Massacre, when Ethan denied any knowledge of it yet had been a resident at the Inn for some time leading up to the killings. Moreover, Rusk's suspicions about Ethan deepened when he could not verify the background of the American. Rusk's investigation eventually led to the home Sir Malcolm Murray where he questioned Murry about Ethan's past, and he was again met with denial with Murry claiming no knowledge of Chandler despite Ethan's frequent visits. Rusk then set a watch on the mansion in the hope of catching Ethan. When the American finally did arrive, Rusk informed him that his every move would be watched, and that he had learned of Ethan's true identity, Ethan Lawrence Talbot. Ethan eventually approached Rusk's office and admitted to committing the Mariner's Inn Massacre, asking to be hanged as soon as possible. Rusk then revealed that Ethan was instead to be extradited back to the Americas. He had received the extradition order weeks earlier, but had refrained from acting upon it because he wanted the satisfaction of hearing Ethan's confession beforehand. After bringing Ethan to America, Ethan's father sends men to intercept Ethan to bring him home. Rusk tells the federal marshals that he will hunt him down with them. After catching up, Rusk discovers the men that rescued Ethan slaughtered from him during the full moon, and discover someone is helping Ethan. After Hecate Poole uses her magic to kill all but the lead marshal and Rusk, Rusk vows to now kill Ethan instead of capture the first chance he gets, regardless of his moral code, claiming he will even shoot him in the back if the opportunity arises.",

It is clear that the Creature is desperately lonely, as a result of both the circumstances of his creation and the fact that he is the only one of his species. This leads him to act in a cold, ruthless manner, particularly towards his creator, whom he hates for abandoning him following his creation. His determination not to be alone results in him threatening Victor Frankenstein with the death of all he loves unless he creates for him an immortal bride. When the Creature grows impatient with Victor's progress, he murders the respected Professor Van Helsing in order to remind Victor of what awaits him if he does not obey. The Creature nonetheless possesses a deeply compassionate side, and generally does not wish to harm others, despite their revulsion of him. He is shown several small acts of kindness by Maud Gunneson, an actress at the Grand Guignol Theatre, but he tragically mistakes her attitude for one of romantic interest, and is almost driven to attack her in grief and anger when she later rejects him. This results in the Creature being dismissed from his job at the theatre - though Vincent expresses regret at doing so - and in his heartbroken state he is willing to let Victor shoot him. Victor's pity is stirred by the sight of his creation reduced to such remorseful suffering, however, and afterwards he begins using the body of the deceased Brona Croft to craft a mate for the Creature.",
